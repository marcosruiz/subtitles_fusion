If you do this, it'll ruin me.
It'll ruin my family.

were selling bed sheets.

00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,210
Yeah, and I also told you
that we're selling other stuff too.

Okay? And nobody
was buying the bed sheets.

No, David, you lied to me.

712
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,448

to bid on Federal contracts.</i>

1896
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:17,800
How's it going?

1897
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:21,841
It's okay.

1898
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,364
If I wanted you dead,
you'd already be dead.

1899
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,246
I guess it's going all right then.

1900
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:35,766
Come in.

1901
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:43,964
How's your baby?

1902
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:45,650
It's a girl, right?

1903
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,729
Yeah. She's good.

1904
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,891
I got three.

1905
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,246
All girls.

1906
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,570
They tell you it gets better.

1907
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:56,967
That's not true, it gets worse.

1908
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,250
That's why I like the arms business.

1909
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,647
(CLEARS THROAT) No women.

1910
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:06,566
(EXHALES)

1911
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:10,931
(SIGHS)

1912
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:16,440
I want to apologize about Albania.

1913
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:22,641
I had bad information.

1914
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:30,890
So you stuffed me in the trunk of a car
and shoved a gun in my face by mistake?

1915
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:32,127
Yeah.

1916
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:37,443
I'm not a bad man,
but in certain situations,

1917
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,085
I have to ask myself,

1918
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,648
what would a bad man do?

1919
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,884
I appreciate you leaving my name
out of your testimony.

1920
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,048
I didn't really see
a reason to include it.

1921
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,765
Yeah, but still.

1922
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:00,531
Can I ask you a question?

1923
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,321
Sure.

1924
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:05,361
(SIGHS)

1925
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,486
When we met in Vegas
at the blackjack table,

1926
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:10,605
was that a coincidence?

1927
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,249
What do you think?

1928
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:15,960
(SCOFFS SOFTLY)

1929
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,484
Can I ask you another question?

1930
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,965
My driver in Albania went missing.

1931
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,288
Do you know what happened to him?

1932
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,926
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

1933
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,764
It's a piece of my end on the Afghan deal.

1934
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,931
It's for you.

1935
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,768
No more questions.

1936
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:10,721
